Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client for this project was a company called DriverPass. Their goal was to create a system that can help people better prepare for their driving tests; be it practice tests or online tests. The staff at DriverPass will also aid any users if they have any other questions or concerns.

What did you do particularly well?

My design was buildt around the interactions that the user, IT officer, DriverPass Non-admin staff, and the assinged driving instructor will have. I think I nailed every possible contingency that each of those groups of people will have.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would make my diagrams more colorful, just because I feel like it would be easier to understand and to look at when showing and discussing it to my collegues.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
